;; The first line is necessary to prevent cua-mode from replacing a bunch of standard keyboard
;; shortcuts with Windows-style things (C-c for copy, C-x for cut etc).
;;
;; Once you're in cua-mode, C-enter will turn on visual rectangles, which you can then expand with
;; the movement keys (arrows, C-n, C-f etc) to cover the text you want to manipulate. While this is
;; going on, hitting enter moves the cursor around the edges of the rectangle, and anything you
;; type is inserted outside the rectangle on the same side as the cursor. The insertion matches
;; the size of the rectangle, so if you want to add the same text to the beginning (or middle or
;; end) of a bunch of lines at once, this is the fastest way to do it.
;;
;; If you disabled the cua keybindings, then C-w will kill the contents of the rectangle.
